            <h3>Studies show that eating lemons makes you stronger</h3>
            <p>Sure lemons are acidic and more often than not people consider them to be
                more sour than sweet. However, scientific studies, as well as true stories,
                have shown that eating lemons is highly beneficial for your health and give
                you super powers. A participant ate a lemon whole and became stronger. They
                were able to flip a table with no problem, though the lemon seems to have
                caused some emotional damage with the participant because they were sweating
                and tears were falling from their eyes. At least that is what the scientists
                claimed happened.

            <h4>Jim Lemon John</h4>
            <p>Jim Lemon John was born and raised in Lemon, Mississipi. Believe it or not that is
                actually a real place. He went to school and graduated with a highschool degree.
                He was inspired to become a lemon expert after learning that lemonade was made
                from lemons. He was so mind blown that he had a dream where he met life. Life gave
                him lemons and he knew what his purpose was.
